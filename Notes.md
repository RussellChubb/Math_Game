# Notes

## Bugs

* Fix bug where the scores aren't correctly being written to the .txt file - Getting weird edge case where sometimes I get a completly different high-scores board. (*This might be just a local issue?*)

## Features / Changes

* Consider breaking the code into pages/views, I feel like having one main .py file is starting to get bloated?

* Move clock to somewhere where people can see the time remaining more easily? (*Not sure how I'd go about this, open to ideas*)

* Implement hot streak (*if you get 3 in a row, you get a custom sound and maybe some kind of fire effect?*)

* Add two different background music tracks, one for the game-state, and one for the menu.

* Add that Minecraft style random text in the top right hand corner of the menu. (*Read from a .txt file in the repo with a list of funny phrases or something?*)

* Create custom .ico file

* Create logo for the game + Draw the logo on the main-screen.

* Fix the fade effect, it currently doesn't work as intended. Also, I'd love more of a pixelated fade rather than a clean fade, as it's more in style with the game.

* Make "Score" larger, (*and maybe glow*) on the finished game scene (*so that people better understand what they achieved*)

* Add a line cursor to the text input field in the game state as well as the enter a name menu once the game has finished.

* Add in the count-down beep, and then the final buzzer sound.

* Duck Background music when transisioning between screens.

* Add in a "*New High Score!*" message when you get a new high score.
